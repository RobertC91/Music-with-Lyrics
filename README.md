# Music-with-Lyrics

## Description

This website was coded using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. It has a search input that stores using local storage and inserts those variables into 2 different API's. One API will return the lyrics of the song and the other API pulls a corresponding Youtube video to view. For now only a partial of the lyrics will show up due to copyright issues with the API, but I plan to implement a better API in the future that will display the full lyrics of your song search.
